Collaborative Project: React JS Simple Programs  As part of our learning journey as fresh graduate developers, my friend SUNITHA and I are collaborating on a simple React JS program. We're utilizing GitHub to share, review, and merge our code, promoting teamwork and version control best practices.
Project Goals:

- Gain hands-on experience with React JS
- Develop problem-solving skills through collaborative coding
- Implement effective communication and project management strategies

We're excited to contribute to open-source projects and learn from the developerÂ community!
